# Cineca User Guide â€” Offline HPC Workflow (Leonardo Cluster)

This repository provides a practical guide for new users of the [CINECA Leonardo Supercomputer](https://www.hpc.cineca.it/) working in **offline environments** (i.e., no internet access on compute nodes). It includes:
- A detailed **PDF guide** (`Cineca_User_Guide.pdf`) where you can find setup steps for Conda, SLURM, offline datasets/models, monitoring and how to set up the project folder properly.
- A **generic SLURM job script** (`test.sh`) template

If you find this guide or the script helpful in your work, **please consider citing or crediting me**.  
It helps me keep the project maintained and encourages further improvements.

Created and maintained by **Livia Oddi**.  
Feel free to open an issue or contact me for questions, suggestions, or additions to the guide.
