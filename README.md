# Cineca User Guide â€” Offline HPC Workflow (Leonardo Cluster)

This repository provides a practical guide for new users of the [CINECA Leonardo Supercomputer](https://www.hpc.cineca.it/) working in **offline environments** (i.e., no internet access on compute nodes). It includes:
- A detailed **PDF guide** (`Cineca_User_Guide.pdf`) with setup steps for Conda, SLURM, offline datasets/models, monitoring, and organizing your project folder.
- A **generic SLURM job script** (`test.sh`) template to launch training jobs.

**This project is still in progress**, I plan to expand the guide and add more templates or tools based on future needs and user feedback.  

If you find this guide or script helpful in your work, **please consider citing or crediting me**.  
It helps keep the project maintained and encourages further improvements.

Created and maintained by **Livia Oddi**.  
Feel free to open an issue or contact me for questions, suggestions, or contributions to the guide.
